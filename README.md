Cool pastel color palette (Ex: Blue + White + Light Gray)

Use modern fonts like "Poppins", "Inter", or "Sora"

leerob.io (Super clean, developer-focused)

delba.dev (Minimal but impactful)

rauno.me (Very research/project focused)

Key Points to Keep in Mind
Consistency wins: Update your blogs and research regularly.

Professionalism: No typos, clean formatting, and updated information.

Storytelling matters: Tell your journey, not just your skills.

Make everything linkable: Blogs, projects, vision â€” everything should have its own URL.

Bonus Tip
Domain Name Tip:
If you want something unique + professional â€” you can buy domains like:

abhisheksingh.dev

singhabhishek.dev

abhishek.codes

abhishekbuilds.com

(You can get these from Namecheap, Google Domains, or GoDaddy.)

Would you also like me to create a starter folder structure + example code to kickstart the Next.js project if you want to begin building right away?
It'll save you a lot of time. ðŸš€
Should I proceed with that?
